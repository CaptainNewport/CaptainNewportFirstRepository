		I may be a 16th century English privateer captain or I also might be a person from Fort Worth. If I wasn't busy sinking Spanish ships or bringing colonists to hopefully not meet their terrible and mysterious untimely deaths like Roanoke, I would have went to TCU and graduated in 2014 and have worked at JCPenney at their Alliance location for 3 years. That facility uses robots which are more complicated than sailboats and inspired me to learn coding.
